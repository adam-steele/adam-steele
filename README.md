## About Me 
I love the fact (nearly) all problems could use code to solve them or help solve them, if you can think it you can make it. 
🔭 I am really excited to be looking for my first role in coding and continuing to learn skills and new technologies. 
I recently undertook an intensive 6-month BCS accredited Le Wagon bootcamp. This not only taught me Ruby and the Rails Framework but also a lot of other skills and tools.

<summary> My Coding journey so far </summary>
<br>
I started my coding journey learning SQL in a role to help me build tools to make my day job easier. This ignited in me a love for coding as a great problem-solving tool. I expanded this during lockdown starting with HMTL and CSS, adding in other languages and tools over time working up to building things with the MERN stack. I have just completed the next step on my journey undertaking an intensive 6-month BCS accredited bootcamp at le Wagon which expanded on my existing knowledge with new technologies. I learned Ruby and the Rails Framework but also a lot of the other technologies and how to work together on a coding project. I am excited about the next stage of my journey, as I look to become a full-stack developer!
