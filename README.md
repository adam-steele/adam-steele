## About Me 
I love the fact basically all problems could use code to solve them or help solve them, if you can think it you can make it. 
🔭 I am really excited to be looking for my first role in coding and continuing skills as well as learn new technologies

<summary> My Coding journey so far </summary>
<br>
I started my coding journey learning SQL in a role to help me build tools to make my day job easier. This ignited in me a love for coding as a great problem-solving tool. I expanded this during lockdown starting with the classic "Hello World!" in HMTL and CSS, adding in other things over time working up to building things with the MERN stack. I recently undertook an intensive 6-month BCS accredited Le Wagon bootcamp which not only taught me the new technologies of Ruby and the Rails Framework but also a lot of the other skills in coding
